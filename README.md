dynamic Competence of systems - structures 
Mainly there are 3 different types of approaches to tackle a structural dynamic problem to qualify the system from dynamic perspective. Such study is important in vibration-related cases where we want to avoid unwanted and destructive oscillations and vibrations: 
a- Numerical approach: FEA-M (Finite element Analysis-Method) - done in Software packages simialr to ANSYS, NASTRAN, ...
b- Experimental: Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) - utilizes Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) to find mostly: the transmissibility of different points, resistance, impedance, eigenvalues or resonance frequencies, eigenmodes or mode shapes, and damping (e.g., Kelvin-Voigt or structural damping) 
Theoretical: applicable only in simple geometries with simple boundary conditions (B.C.) or interfaces.
